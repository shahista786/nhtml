            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.</p>
            <p>There are four required tags in HTML. These are html, title, head and body. The table below shows you the opening and closing tag.</p>
            <p>HTML is not a programming language. It's a markup language. In fact, that is the technology's name: HyperText Markup Language.</p>
